# SkylarkDrones_GCPFinder

This repository contains the my solution to the coding assignment for Skylark Drones. 
The assignment was to find 'L' shaped white Ground Control Points (GCPs) from the given images.

# Method Used

The method I have used to solve this problem is using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) method along with Blunt Force Matching. A point to be noted is that the results can be improved by changing the feature extraction and matching methods, but the main idea is the same.

# Results

The following is a correctly placed marker by the method mentioned above.
